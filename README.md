- 👋 Hi, I’m @Miladatasys
- 👀 I'm interested in expanding my knowledge through computer engineering.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning programming languages, game dev, requirements management, prototyping, UX, web design, and anything else that will help me improve my skills.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate and work on new personal and team projects where I can learn and grow much more than I expected.
- 🌼 Quality is one of my primary interests in the development field.
